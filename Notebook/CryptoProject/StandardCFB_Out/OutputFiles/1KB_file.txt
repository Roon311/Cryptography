Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St. Leo's certainly had the upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points to 2. Each time St. Leo's scored, they pounded the ground in unison, further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, in these circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat?






The first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched. Michael's fought point for point against a Leo's team whose defence was almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan managed to hit home some impressive spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found themselves unable to finish the job and St Leo's stormed into the second set with a 25-22 win in the first set under their belt.
